# Will you be our neighbor?
Data driven selection of winning neighborhoods.

Inspired by data suggesting the importance of community as it correlates to success and health, this collaboration of four data scientists identified markers of residential areas with reciprocal support between citizens and the community itself. We utilized both national and local data, which in our case is San Diego, California. 

As may be expected, we evaluated the usual markers of employment rates, affordability and education. However, as a way of assessing community ties, we also included data on small specialty businesses with the thought that they were only likely to survive if they had the support of the neighborhood.
